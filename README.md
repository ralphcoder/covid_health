## Discription

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
**My First Flutter App**😅

This application is useful to have a quick peek on health, it gives an overview of whether you are becoming overweight, underweight, or normal.

It takes the input of your height, weight, and age. This is used to calculate your BMI(Body Mass Index) which in turn is used in calculating your health.

The app is made simple and with good UI..

This repository also contains an **apk** to install directly on the device. 
So have a check on your health💪..
